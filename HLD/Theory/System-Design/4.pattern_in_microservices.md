# Microservice Design Patterns

## 1. Decomposition Patterns
### a. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Divide the application into domains, using bounded contexts to create services around business capabilities.

### b. Subdomain Decomposition
- Decompose the system based on:
  - **Core Subdomains**: Critical business functionalities.
  - **Supporting Subdomains**: Complementary but not core.
  - **Generic Subdomains**: Common functionalities like authentication.

## 2. Saga Pattern
- Manages distributed transactions by coordinating a series of local transactions.

### Types:
- **Choreography**:
  - Decentralized; each service listens to and reacts to events.
- **Orchestration**:
  - Centralized controller manages the workflow and communication between services.

## 3. Strangler Fig Pattern
- Gradual migration from a legacy system to microservices:
  1. Build new microservices alongside the legacy system.
  2. Redirect traffic incrementally to the new services.
  3. Fully deprecate the legacy system.

## 4. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- Separates the handling of **commands** (write operations) and **queries** (read operations).

### Features:
- **Command Model**:
  - Optimized for updates and complex business logic.
- **Query Model**:
  - Optimized for fast read operations.
- Enables scalability and performance optimization by independently scaling read and write models.
