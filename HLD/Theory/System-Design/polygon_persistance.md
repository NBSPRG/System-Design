# Polygon Persistence

**Polyglot persistence is an approach where multiple types of databases are used in the same system, each chosen for its specific strengths.** 

For example:

- RDBMS: Transactions.
- NoSQL (Document DB): Unstructured data.
- Graph DB: Relationships.
- Key-Value Store: Caching.

It optimizes performance and flexibility but adds complexity in management and integration.
