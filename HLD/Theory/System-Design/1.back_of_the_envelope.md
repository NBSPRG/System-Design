##  Back of the envelope

To choose which design to follow, and estimate their requirements.

- we should know about the scalability.
- know about power of 2
- know about latency
- know about availability(downtime)

- memory is faster than disk
- avoiding disk seek
- compress the data before sending
- data centers are far located, avoid such round trip time.

### Availability

- 99% - 100% most of the services now-a-days.

- **SLA**: Service Level Agreement -> An agreement between service provider and consumer about service availability.
