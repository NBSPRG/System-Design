# Indexing
This repository gives you an enjoyable experience of learning the implementation part of indexing which is used in various places in computer science.

I have implemented various indexing here. These are :
- **[Simple Indexing:](https://gitlab.com/NBSPRG/indexing-implementation/-/blob/main/1.simple_indexing.cpp)** This is based on the map data structure.
- **[Two Level Indexing:](https://gitlab.com/NBSPRG/indexing-implementation/-/blob/main/2.two_level_indexing.cpp)** This is basically implemented with the nested map data structure. 
- **[Multi-Level Indexing:](https://gitlab.com/NBSPRG/indexing-implementation/-/blob/main/3.multi_level_indexing.cpp)** This is the generalization of Two Level Indexing to the N-Level. 
- **[BTree:](https://gitlab.com/NBSPRG/indexing-implementation/-/blob/main/4.btree.cpp)** This has been implemented in order to get the thorough understanding of how the indexing works in database and file system. It gives you knowledge about how B-Tree helps get limited access of blocks of disk with maximum keys in reasonable time.
- **[B+ Tree:](https://gitlab.com/NBSPRG/indexing-implementation/-/blob/main/5.b+tree.cpp)** This is an advanced version of BTree which takes care of range query by adding a link between the leaf node which is only that stores data rather than BTree which stores data in both leaves and internal nodes.
- **[Unordered_map:](https://gitlab.com/NBSPRG/indexing-implementation/-/blob/main/6.unordered_map_implementation.cpp)** This contains the implementation of hashmap data structure which is just in simple a list of linked list.
