# Netflix-Style Database Cache with Bloom Filter

This project recreates the Netflix case study showing how Bloom filters can optimize database queries and reduce expensive disk I/O operations by 80%, leading to sub-millisecond response times.

## üé¨ Netflix Case Study Recreation

**The Problem:**
- Netflix processes billions of user interactions daily
- Each query potentially requires checking multiple disk-based SSTables  
- Disk I/O is 1000x slower than memory access
- Users expect sub-millisecond response times

**The Solution:**
- Each SSTable has an associated Bloom filter in memory
- Before expensive disk reads, Bloom filter determines if key might exist
- 95% of non-existent key queries avoid disk I/O entirely
- Only potential matches trigger actual disk reads

**Quantified Impact:**
- Read latency reduced from 50ms to 5ms average
- Disk I/O reduced by 80%
- Supported 10x increase in user traffic without hardware scaling

## üöÄ Project Features

### 1. Built-in Bloom Filter Implementation
Uses the production-ready `github.com/bits-and-blooms/bloom/v3` library that provides:
- Optimal bit array sizing
- Multiple hash functions
- Memory-efficient implementation
- Production-tested reliability

### 2. Custom Bloom Filter Implementation
Built from scratch to understand the internals:
- Mathematical optimization for size and hash functions
- Multiple hash algorithms (FNV, MD5, SHA1, SHA256)
- Configurable false positive rates
- Performance statistics

### 3. Real-World Use Case
Simulates a user profile lookup system with:
- **Multi-tier caching**: Memory cache ‚Üí Bloom filter ‚Üí Disk database
- **Realistic latencies**: 5ms disk I/O simulation
- **Production scenarios**: High load testing with thousands of queries
- **Performance metrics**: Cache hit rates, disk read avoidance, response times

- Shows cache hits/misses
- Demonstrates disk I/O avoidance
- Measures response times
- Displays performance statistics

### 2. Implementation Comparison

- See cache behavior in action
- Observe response times
- Add new users dynamically

### 4. Performance Stress Test
Simulate Netflix-scale load:
- 10,000+ users in database
- 50,000+ concurrent queries
- Performance metrics
- Scalability demonstration

## üìä Key Performance Metrics

The system tracks and displays:
- **Cache Hit Rate**: Percentage of queries served from memory
- **Disk Read Avoidance**: Percentage of expensive I/O operations prevented
- **Response Times**: Sub-millisecond performance for cached data
- **False Positive Rate**: Bloom filter accuracy metrics
- **Throughput**: Queries per second capability

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Built-in Bloom Filter
```go
// Production-ready implementation
bf := bloom.NewWithEstimates(expectedItems, falsePositiveRate)
bf.Add([]byte(key))
exists := bf.Test([]byte(key))
```

### Custom Bloom Filter
```go
// Educational implementation
bf := NewCustomBloomFilter(expectedItems, falsePositiveRate)
bf.Add([]byte(key))
exists := bf.Test([]byte(key))
```

### Database Cache Integration
```go
// Netflix-style optimization
func (dc *DatabaseCache) GetUser(userID string) (*UserProfile, bool) {
    // 1. Check memory cache (fastest)
    if user, exists := dc.cache[userID]; exists {
        return user, true // Sub-millisecond response
    }
    
    // 2. Check Bloom filter (fast)
    if !dc.bloomFilter.Test([]byte(userID)) {
        return nil, false // Definitely doesn't exist
    }
    
    // 3. Check database (expensive, only when necessary)
    return dc.checkDatabase(userID)
}
```
